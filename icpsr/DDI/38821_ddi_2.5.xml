            <abstract contentType="abstract">ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly) was a multisite randomized controlled trial conducted at six field sites with New England Research Institutes (NERI) as the coordinating center. The field sites included the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Hebrew Senior Life (formerly Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged) in Boston, Indiana University, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Pennsylvania State University, and Wayne State University (Detroit). Data in this study are drawn from measures of cognitively demanding daily activities performed by participants who received a variety of cognitive interventions. Measures included both cognitive functioning (memory, inductive reasoning, speed processing, and general knowledge) and daily functioning (everyday problem solving, observations of daily living, complex reaction time, and general functional ability). Secondary to these measures, the study also includes data on health care and service utilization, driving habits, and mobility. Data were collected at the start of the study (baseline) as well as one, two, three, five, and ten years into the study. 
This collection integrates data from two previous collections (ICPSR 4248  and ICPSR 36036) and fills in gaps that existed in these two collections. In addition, this collection features composite scores for constructs like memory, reasoning speed, Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Social Determinants of Health (SDOH), as well as data from the National Death Index and state driving records.</abstract>
            <abstract contentType="purpose">PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of cognitive interventions in maintaining cognitive health and functional independence in older adults.</abstract>
            <abstract contentType="mixed">STUDY DESIGN:  Eligible participants were randomly assigned to one of three intervention arms or the no-contact control group. 
Eligibility and demographic data (age, gender, race, education, and marital status) were gathered in a telephone screening. Health history (self-report of diabetes, myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke, hypertension, high cholesterol, and current alcohol use), physical status, functional status, mental status and cognitive and function measures were gathered via in-person examinations in individual and small-group formats at baseline. </abstract>
            <abstract contentType="mixed">DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLES: Variables in this study include information about memory, inductive reasoning, speed processing, everyday problem solving, observations of daily living, reaction time, health care and service utilization, driving habits, and mobility.</abstract>

                <sampProc>The sample consisted of 2,832 persons aged 65 to 94 recruited from 6 metropolitan areas in the United States. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) recruited participants from residents of Jefferson County, Alabama, who were licensed to drive or who possessed nondriver identification cards issued through the Alabama Department of Public Safety, and they recruited from UAB eye clinics. The Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged (HRCA) in Boston, Massachusetts, recruited from congregate and senior housing sites, senior centers, and a registry of volunteers for aging research at the Harvard Cooperative Program on Aging. Indiana University recruited clients of the Community Centers of Indianapolis and through local churches and senior organizations. Johns Hopkins University recruited from senior centers, churches, senior housing, and senior organizations in the Baltimore, Maryland, metropolitan area and in Cumberland, Maryland. Pennsylvania State University recruited from the enrollment files of a state-funded pharmaceutical assistance program for low-income elders, called PACE. Wayne State University recruited from community organizations, churches, and senior housing in metropolitan Detroit, as well as from state of Michigan driver registration lists. The study design also included a no-contact control group.</sampProc>

Time-invariant variables are included in a stand-alone file. In addition, there are separate files for NDI data, training process data, MVA driving data, occupation classification data, and disposition forms.</notes>
            <notes>For analysis, the variable <strong>ID</strong> (deidentified) can be used to link all records. Please refer to the ReadMe document for additional details.</notes>
