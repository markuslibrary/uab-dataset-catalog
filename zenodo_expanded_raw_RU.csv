Yet, plant lincRNAs remain poorly characterized and how lincRNA biogenesis is regulated is unclear. Using a reproducibility-based bioinformatics strategy to analyze 200 Arabidopsis transcriptome datasets, we identified 13,230 intergenic transcripts of which 6,480 can be classified as lincRNAs. Expression of 2,708 lincRNAs was detected by RNA-seq experiments. Transcriptome profiling by custom microarrays revealed that the majority of these lincRNAs are expressed at a level between those of mRNAs and pri-miRNAs. A subset of lincRNA genes show organ-specific expression whereas others are responsive to biotic and/or abiotic stresses. Further analysis of transcriptome data in 11 mutants uncovered SERRATE, CBP20, and CBP80 as regulators of lincRNA expression and biogenesis. RT-PCR experiments confirmed these 3 proteins are also needed for splicing of a small group of intron-containing lincRNAs.",open,"['Arabidopsis thaliana', 'Noncoding RNA', 'lincRNA']",[{'place': 'New York'}],cc-zero,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Supplemental Dataset 1.

How motivation facilitates learning is not well understood. We designed a behavioral task in which mice self-initiate trials to learn cue-reward contingencies and found that the anterior cingulate region of the prefrontal cortex (ACC) contains motivation-related signals to maximize rewards. In particular, we found that ACC neural activity was consistently tied to trial initiations where mice seek to leave unrewarded cues to reach reward-associated cues. Notably, this neural signal persisted over consecutive unrewarded cues until reward associated cues were reached, and was required for learning. To determine how ACC inherits this motivational signal we performed projection specific photometry recordings from several inputs to ACC during learning. In doing so, we identified a ramp in bulk neural activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) -to-ACC projections as mice received unrewarded cues, which continued ramping across consecutive unrewarded cues, and finally peaked upon reaching a reward associated cue, thus maintaining an extended motivational state. Cellular resolution imaging of OFC confirmed these neural correlates of motivation, and further delineated separate ensembles of neurons that sequentially tiled the ramp. Together, these results identify a mechanism by which OFC maps out task structure to convey an extended motivational state to ACC to facilitate goal-directed learning.</p>",open,,,cc-by-4.0,,https://zenodo.org/records/11451977,https://zenodo.org/records/11451976,10.5281/zenodo.11451976,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11451977,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11451976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Regalado, Josue",Rockefeller University,0000-0002-6798-3860,"Corredera Asensio, Ariadna",Rockefeller University,0000-0003-4289-4500,"Haunold, Theresa",Rockefeller University,,"Toader, Andrew",Rockefeller University,0000-0003-3194-0604,"Li, Yan Ran",Rockefeller University,,"Neal, Lauren",Rockefeller University,0000-0002-0092-2852,"Rajasethupathy, Priyamvada",Rockefeller University,0000-0001-8741-2347,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results support a leaky ribosome scanning model for polymerase translation, provide a fitness map of the HBV polymerase at single nucleotide resolution, and identify conserved prolines adjacent to the HBV polymerase termination codon that stall ribosomes.

However, in many species, experimental control over important factors that regulate division of labor, such as genotype and age, is limited. Furthermore, most species have fixed queen and worker castes, making it difficult to establish causality between the molecular mechanisms that underlie reproductive division of labor, the hallmark of insect societies. Here we present the genome of the queenless clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi, a powerful new study system that does not suffer from these constraints. Using cytology and RAD-seq, we show that C. biroi reproduces via automixis with central fusion and that heterozygosity is lost extremely slowly. As a consequence, nestmates are almost clonally related (r = 0.996). Workers in C. biroi colonies synchronously alternate between reproduction and brood care, and young workers eclose in synchronized cohorts. We show that genes associated with division of labor in other social insects are conserved in C. biroi and dynamically regulated during the colony cycle. With unparalleled experimental control over an individual's genotype and age, and the ability to induce reproduction and brood care, C. biroi has great potential to illuminate the molecular regulation of division of labor.",open,"['Atta cephalotes', 'Cerapachys biroi', 'Social evolution', 'Dorylomorpha', 'Harpegnathos saltator', 'gustatory receptor', 'brood care', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Vitellogenin', 'Solenopsis invicta', 'Acromyrmex echinatior', 'Camponotus floridanus', 'Linepithema humile', 'ionotropic receptor', 'UDP glycosyltransferase', 'odorant receptor', 'Pogonomyrmex barbatus', 'Chemosensory proteins']",,cc-zero,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Gene details for Cerapachys biroi chemosensory genes, UGTs and CYPs<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Tab 1 contains details of all manually annotated chemosensory genes from Cerapachys biroi.

In this work, we measured an array of cognitive skills - namely problem-solving, associative and reversal learning, and self-control - across 214 individuals of 23 bird species, including 19 wild-caught songbird species and two vocal nonlearning species. We found that the greater the vocal learning abilities of a species, the better their problem-solving skills and the relatively larger their brains.

Two families of small soluble proteins, the odorant binding and chemosensory proteins (OBPs and CSPs), are believed to be important in insect chemosensation. To better understand the role of these proteins in ant olfaction, we examined their evolution and expression across the ants using phylogenetics and sex- and tissue-specific RNA-seq. Results: We find that subsets of both OBPs and CSPs are expressed in the antennae, contradicting the previous hypothesis that CSPs have replaced OBPs in ant olfaction. Both protein families have several highly conserved clades with a single ortholog in all eusocial hymenopterans, as well as clades with more dynamic evolution and many taxon-specific radiations. The dynamically evolving OBPs and CSPs have been hypothesized to function in chemical communication. Intriguingly, we find that seven members of the conserved clades are expressed specifically in the antennae of the clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi, whereas only one dynamically evolving CSP is antenna specific. The orthologs of the conserved, antenna-specific C. biroi genes are also expressed in antennae of the ants Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator, indicating that antenna-specific expression of these OBPs and CSPs is conserved across ants. Most members of the dynamically evolving clades in both protein families are expressed primarily in non-chemosensory tissues and thus likely do not fulfill chemosensory functions. Conclusions: Our results identify candidate OBPs and CSPs that are likely involved in conserved aspects of ant olfaction, and suggest that OBPs and CSPs may not rapidly evolve to recognize species-specific signals.",open,"['CSP', 'Cerapachys biroi', 'chemosensation', 'Harpegnathos saltator', 'sociogenomics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Solenopsis invicta', 'Camponotus floridanus',

This is reflected in their ability to segment the visual scene into task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus components and by changing their tuning to task-relevant stimulus properties according to the current top-down instruction. Differences between the information represented in each area were seen. While V1 represented detailed stimulus characteristics, V4 filtered the input from V1 to carry the binary information required for the two-alternative judgement task. Neurons in V1 were activated at locations where the behaviorally relevant stimulus was placed well outside the grating-mapped receptive field. By systematically following the development of the task-dependent signals over the course of perceptual learning, we found that neuronal selectivity for task-relevant information was initially seen in V4 and, over a period of weeks, subsequently in V1. Once the learned information was represented in V1, on any given trial, task-relevant information appeared initially in V1 responses, followed by a 12-ms delay in V4.

Consequently, offspring traits are influenced by the genes of their caregivers via indirect genetic effects (IGEs). However, the extent to which IGEs are modulated by environmental factors, other than the genotype of social partners (i.e., intergenomic epistasis), remains an open question. Here we investigate how broods are influenced by the genotype of their caregivers in the clonal raider ant, <em>Ooceraea biroi</em>, a species in which the genotype, age, and number of both caregivers and brood can be experimentally controlled. First, we used four clonal lines to establish colonies that differed only in the genotype of caregivers and measured effects on foraging activity, as well as IGEs on brood phenotypes. In a second experiment, we tested whether these IGEs are conditional on the age and number of caregivers. We found that caregiver genotype affected the feeding and foraging activity of colonies, and influenced the rate of development, survival, body size, and caste fate of brood. Caregiver genotype interacted with other factors to influence the rate of development and survival of brood, demonstrating that IGEs can be conditional. Thus, we provide an empirical example of phenotypes being influenced by IGE-by-environment interactions beyond intergenomic epistasis, highlighting that IGEs of caregivers/parents are alterable by factors other than their brood's/offspring's genotype.</p>",open,"['Biological sciences', 'automated tracking', 'ant behavior', 'brood care', 'Caregivers', 'gene-environment interaction', 'indirect genetic effects', 'Offspring phenotype', 'Ooceraea biroi', 'parental care', 'phenotypic plasticity', 'parent-offspring interaction']",,cc-zero,"<p>R 4.1.2 (or higher), Excel</p>

Trajectories of diffusing Piezo1 molecules, which exhibit confined Brownian diffusion on short timescales and hopping on long timescales, also reflect a bias towards the dimple. This bias can be explained by ""curvature coupling"" between the intrinsic curvature of the Piezo dome and the curvature of the red blood cell membrane.

However, despite decades of research, our knowledge of army ant symbionts remains fragmentary due to taxonomic ambiguity and the inability to study army ants in the lab. Here we present an integrative approach that allows us to reliably determine species boundaries, assess biodiversity, match different developmental stages and sexes, and to study the life cycles of army ant symbionts. This approach is based on a combination of community sampling, DNA barcoding, morphology and physiology. As a test case, we applied this approach to the staphylinid beetle genus Vatesus and its different Eciton army ant host species at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. DNA barcoding led to the discovery of cryptic biodiversity and, in combination with extensive community sampling, revealed strict host partitioning with no overlap in host range. Using DNA barcoding, we were also able to match the larval stages of all focal Vatesus species. In combination with studies of female reproductive physiology, this allowed us to reconstruct almost the complete life cycles of the different beetle species. We show that Vatesus beetles are highly adapted to the symbiosis with army ants, in that their reproduction and larval development are synchronized with the stereotypical reproductive and behavioral cycles of their host colonies. Our approach can now be used to study army ant-symbiont communities more broadly, and to obtain novel insights into co-evolutionary and ecological dynamics in species-rich host-symbiont systems.",open,"['Social parasitism', 'Vatesus goianus', 'Species Interactions', 'Host Parasite Interactions', 'Life History Evolution', 'symbiosis', 'Vatesus clypeatus', 'Host specificity', 'myrmecophiles']",[{'place': 'Costa Rica'}],cc-zero,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Alignment CAD_wingless<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Alignment of concatenated wg and CAD sequences of Vatesus beetles.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Alignment COI<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Alignment of COI sequences of Vatesus beetles.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">CAD_Wingless phylogenetic tree<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Newick tree file of concatenated wg and CAD sequences of Vatesus beetles.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">COI phylogenetic tree<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Newick tree file of COI sequences of Vatesus beetles.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",https://zenodo.org/records/5026384,https://zenodo.org/records/5026383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"von Beeren, Christoph",Rockefeller University,,"Maruyama, Munetoshi",Kyushu University,,"Kronauer, Daniel J.C.",Rockefeller University,,"Kronauer, Daniel J.

How this information is exchanged between face-processing centers and brain areas supporting social cognition remains largely unclear. Here we identify these routes using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging in macaque monkeys. We find that face areas functionally connect to specific regions within frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, as well as subcortical structures supporting emotive, mnemonic, and cognitive functions. This establishes the existence of an extended face-recognition system in the macaque. Furthermore, the face patch resting state networks and the default mode network in monkeys show a pattern of overlap akin to that between the social brain and the default mode network in humans: this overlap specifically includes the posterior superior temporal sulcus, medial parietal, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, areas supporting high-level social cognition in humans.

In some species where colonies are either headed by multiple queens or single queens that mate with many males, hybridization is associated with genetic caste determination, where hybrids develop into workers and purebred individuals develop into queens. A previous study suggested that hybridization occurs between two Dorylus army ant species with multiply mate queens. However, the extent and exact pattern of hybridization has remained unclear, and its possible effect on caste determination has not been investigated. In this study we aimed to determine the extent and direction of hybridization by measuring how frequently hybrids occur in colonies of both species, and to investigate the possibility of genetic caste determination. We show that hybridization is bidirectional and occurs at equal rates in both species. Hybrid workers make up only 1-2% of the population, and interspecific matings represent approximately 2% of all matings in both species. This shows that, while interspecific matings that give rise to worker offspring occur regularly, they are much rarer than intraspecific mating. Finally, we find no evidence of an association between hybridization and genetic caste determination in this population. This means that genetic caste determination is not a necessary outcome of hybridization in ants, even in species where queens mate with multiple males.",open,"['Dorylus wilverthi', 'genetic caste determination', 'Dorylinae', 'army ants', 'Dorylus molestus']","[{'place': 'Africa'}, {'place': 'Kakamega Forest'}, {'place': 'Kenya'}]",cc-zero,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Microsatellite data for samples of Dorylus molestus and D. wilverthi in Kakamega Forest<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Colony samples from 50 colonies collected in Kakamega Forest, Kenya in 2012.

Here, we characterize the relationship between an animal's arousal state and a rare decision to leave a patch of bacterial food. Using long-term tracking and behavioral state classification, we find that food leaving decisions in <em>C. elegans</em> are coupled to arousal states across multiple timescales. Leaving emerges probabilistically over minutes from the high arousal roaming state, but is suppressed during the low arousal dwelling state. Immediately before leaving, animals have a brief acceleration in speed that appears as a characteristic signature of this behavioral motif. Neuromodulatory mutants and optogenetic manipulations that increase roaming have a coupled increase in leaving rates, and similarly acute manipulations that inhibit feeding induce both roaming and leaving. By contrast, inactivating a set of chemosensory neurons that depend on the cGMP-gated transduction channel TAX-4 uncouples roaming and leaving dynamics. In addition, <em>tax-4-</em>expressing sensory neurons promote lawn-leaving behaviors that are elicited by feeding inhibition. Our results indicate that sensory neurons responsive to both internal and external cues play an integrative role in arousal and foraging decisions.</p>",open,"['Behavior', 'Foraging', 'Hidden Markov models', 'Optogenetics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans']",,cc-zero,"<p>Data is in .pkl format, which can be opened using Python (I used Python version 3.8.3).</p>

However, it is unclear what factors are most important in influencing particular host-microbe associations. While closely related animal species may have more similar microbiota than distantly related ones due to phylogenetic contingencies, social partnerships with other organisms, such as those in which one animal farms another, may also influence an organism's symbiotic microbiome. We studied a mutualistic network of Brachymyrmex and Lasius ants farming several honeydew-producing Prociphilus aphids and Rhizoecus mealybugs to test whether the mutualistic microbiomes of these interacting insects are primarily correlated with their phylogeny or with their shared social partnerships. Our results confirm a phylogenetic signal in the microbiomes of aphid and mealybug trophobionts, with each species harboring species-specific endosymbiont strains of Buchnera (aphids), Tremblaya and Sodalis (mealybugs), and Serratia (both mealybugs and aphids) despite being farmed by the same ants. This is likely explained by strict vertical transmission of trophobiont endosymbionts between generations. In contrast, the ants' microbiome is potentially shaped by their social partnerships, with ants that farm the same trophobionts also sharing strains of sugar-processing Acetobacteraceae bacteria, known from other honeydew-feeding ants and which likely reside extracellularly in the ants' guts. These ant-microbe associations are arguably more 'open' and subject to horizontal transmission or social transmission within ant colonies. These findings suggest that the role of social partnerships in shaping a host's symbiotic microbiome can be variable, and is likely dependent on how the microbes are transmitted across generations.",open,"['Lasius claviger', 'Lasius nearcticus', 'Buchnera aphidicola', 'Sodalis', 'Lasius flavus', 'Endosymbionts', 'Prociphilus fraxinifolii', 'Lasius umbratus', 'Candidatus Tremblaya princeps', 'Brachymyrmex depilis', 'Prociphilus longianus', 'Prociphilus probosceus', 'ants', 'Serratia symbiotica', 'aphids', 'Prociphilus erigeronensis', 'Holocene', 'Rhizoecus sp.', 'Mealybugs']","[{'place': 'USA: Millbrook'}, {'place': 'NY'}]",cc-zero,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Ivens et al. 2018 Mol.

<p>Organisms maintain metabolic homeostasis through the combined functions of small molecule transporters and enzymes. While many of the metabolic components have been well-established, a substantial number remains without identified physiological substrates. To bridge this gap, we have leveraged large-scale plasma metabolome genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to develop a multiomic Gene-Metabolite Associations Prediction (GeneMAP) discovery platform. GeneMAP can generate accurate predictions and even pinpoint genes that are distant from the variants implicated by GWAS. In particular, our analysis identified SLC25A48 as a genetic determinant of plasma choline levels. Mechanistically, SLC25A48 loss strongly impairs mitochondrial choline import and synthesis of its downstream metabolite, betaine. Integrative rare variant and polygenic score analyses provide strong evidence that the SLC25A48 causal effects on human disease may in part be mediated by the effects of choline. Altogether, our study provides a discovery platform for metabolic gene function and proposes SLC25A48 as a mitochondrial choline transporter.</p>

In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, the presence of a Mendelian 'supergene' is both necessary and sufficient to induce a shift in a fundamental property of social organization, from single-queen (monogyne) to multiple-queen (polygyne) colonies. This selfish genetic element, termed the Social b (Sb) supergene, contains &gt; 600 genes that collectively promote its fitness by inducing the characteristic polygyne syndrome, in part by causing polygyne workers to accept only queens bearing the Sb element (a behaviour termed 'worker Sb discrimination'). Here, we employ a newly developed behavioural assay to reveal that polygyne workers, many of which bear the Sb element, employ chemical cues on the cuticle of queens to achieve worker Sb discrimination, but we found no evidence for such pheromonally mediated worker Sb discrimination in monogyne workers, which universally lack the Sb element. This polygyne worker Sb discrimination was then verified through a 'green beard' effect previously described in this system. We thus have demonstrated that the Sb element is required both for production of relevant chemical cues of queens and for expression of the behaviours of workers that collectively result in worker Sb discrimination. This information fills a critical gap in the map between genotype and complex phenotype in S. invicta by restricting the search for candidate genes and molecules involved in producing this complex social trait to factors associated with the Sb element itself.",open,"['supergene', 'Gp-9', 'polygyny', 'Insecta', 'Arthropoda', 'Semiochemicals', 'Pheromones', 'Solenopsis invicta']",,cc-zero,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Worker Sb discrimination data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Worker Sb Discrimination assay scores for SB/SB and SB/Sb queens, with Wilcoxon tests and multiple-comparison correction analyses, yielding data reported in Figure 1 and Figure 2.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Green beard assay-data summaries<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Raw data for hexane and methanol Green Beard assays.

Recent advancements in long-read and long-range genome sequencing have made it possible to produce high-quality chromosome-level genome assemblies for almost any organism. However, adequate tissue preservation for the requisite ultra-high molecular weight DNA (uHMW DNA) remains a major challenge. Here we present a comparative study of preservation methods for field and laboratory tissue sampling, across vertebrate classes and different tissue types. We find that no single method is best for all cases. Instead, the optimal storage and extraction methods vary by taxa, by tissue, and by down-stream application. Therefore, we provide sample preservation guidelines that ensure sufficient DNA integrity and amount required for use with long-read and long-range sequencing technologies across vertebrates. Our best practices generate the uHMW DNA needed for the high-quality reference genomes for Phase 1 of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), whose ultimate mission is to generate chromosome-level reference genome assemblies of all ~70,000 extant vertebrate species.</p>",open,"['femto pulse', 'PFGE', 'long-read sequencing', 'genome assembly', 'tissue preservation', 'HMW DNA extraction']",,cc-zero,"<p><strong>FEMTO</strong>: A directory containing subfolders with FEMTO Pulse outputs.

These defences often rely on the detection of infectious individuals, but this can be achieved in several ways that are difficult to differentiate. Here, we combine non-pathogenic immune challenges with automated tracking in colonies of the clonal raider ant to ask whether ants can detect the immune status of their social partners and to quantify their behavioural responses to this perceived infection risk. We first show that a key behavioural response elicited by live pathogens (allogrooming) can be qualitatively recapitulated by immune challenges alone. Automated scoring of interactions between all colony members reveals that this behavioural response increases the network centrality of immune-challenged individuals through a general increase in physical contacts. These results show that ants can detect the immune status of their nestmates and respond with a general ""caring"" strategy, rather than avoidance, towards social partners that are perceived to be infectious. Finally, we find no evidence that changes in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles drive these behavioural effects.</p>",open,"['clonal raider ant', 'Social immunity', 'automated tracking', 'interaction network', 'Ooceraea biroi']",,cc-zero,<p>Funding provided by: Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711<br>Award Number: PZ00P3_168066</p><p>Funding provided by: Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011958<br>Award Number: 4090-00032</p><p>Funding provided by: Human Frontier Science Program<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412<br>Award Number: LT001049/2015</p><p>Funding provided by: Pew Charitable Trusts<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875<br>Award Number: Biomedical Scholar Award</p><p>Funding provided by: H2020 European Research Council<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663<br>Award Number: Advanced grant</p><p>Funding provided by: H2020 European Research Council<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663<br>Award Number: Starting grant</p>,https://zenodo.org/records/5565431,https://zenodo.org/records/5565430,,,,,,,,,"https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/record:5565431:README.pdf/full/^10,/0/default.jpg","https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/record:5565431:README.pdf/full/^50,/0/default.jpg","https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/record:5565431:README.pdf/full/^100,/0/default.jpg","https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/record:5565431:README.pdf/full/^250,/0/default.jpg","https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/record:5565431:README.pdf/full/^750,/0/default.jpg","https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/record:5565431:README.pdf/full/^1200,/0/default.jpg",,,,,,,"Alciatore, Giacomo",Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich,0000-0001-5626-728X,"Ugelvig, Line V.",University of Copenhagen,,"Frank, Erik",University of Würzburg,,"Bidaux, Jérémie",University of Lausanne,,"Gal, Asaf",Rockefeller University,,"Schmitt, Thomas",University of Würzburg,,"Kronauer, Daniel J.C.",Rockefeller University,,"Ulrich, Yuko",Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.5281/zenodo.5513857,isDerivedFrom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the formation of the isthmus was complete around 3 million years ago (Ma), recent studies have suggested prior intercontinental biotic exchange. In particular, the possibility of early intermittent land bridges facilitating colonization constitutes a potential mechanism for speciation and colonization before full closure of the isthmus. To test this hypothesis, we employed genomic methods to study the biogeography of the army ant genus Eciton, a group of keystone arthropod predators in Neotropical rainforests. Army ant colonies are unable to disperse across water and are therefore ideally suited to study the biogeographic impact of land bridge formation. Using a reduced representation genome sequencing approach, we show that all strictly Central American lineages of Eciton diverged from their respective South American sister lineage between 4 and 7 Ma, significantly prior to the complete closure of the isthmus. Furthermore, three of the lineage pairs form extensive and coincident secondary contact zones in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, with no evidence of gene flow. Such a discrete and repeated biogeographic pattern indicates at least two waves of army ant dispersal into Central America that were separated by significant genetic divergence times. Thus, by integrating phylogenomic, population genomic and geographic evidence, we show that early colonization of Central America across the emerging Isthmus of Panamá drove parallel speciation in Eciton army ants.",open,"['Tertiary Period', 'Great American Biotic Interchange', 'Eciton']","[{'place': 'Isthmus of Panama'}, {'place': 'Neotropics'}]",cc-zero,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Concatenated data matrix<div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">concatenated_data_matrix.phy<br></div></div>",https://zenodo.org/records/5018208,https://zenodo.org/records/5018207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Winston, Max E.",University of Chicago,,"Kronauer, Daniel J.

Periodical cicadas exhibit an extraordinary capacity for self-organising spatially synchronous breeding behavior. The regular emergence of periodical cicada broods across the US is a phenomenon of longstanding public and scientific interest, as the cicadas of each brood emerge in huge numbers and briefly dominate their ecosystem. During the emergence, the 17-year periodical cicada species Magicicada cassini is found to form synchronised choruses, and we investigated their chorusing behavior from the standpoint of spatial synchrony.</p>

<p>2. Cicada choruses were observed to form in trees, calling regularly every five seconds. In order to determine the limits of this self-organising behaviour, we set out to quantify the spatial synchronisation between cicada call choruses in different trees, and how and why this varies in space and time.</p>

<p>3. We performed 20 simultaneous recordings in Clinton State Park, Kansas, in June 2015 (Brood IV) with a team of citizen-science volunteers using consumer equipment (smartphones). We use a wavelet approach to show in detail how spatially synchronous, self-organised chorusing varies across the forest.</p>

<p>4. We show how conditions that increase the strength of audio interactions between cicadas also increase the spatial synchrony of their chorusing. Higher forest canopy light levels increase cicada activity, corresponding to faster and higher-amplitude chorus cycling and to greater synchrony of cycles across space. We implemented a relaxation-oscillator-ensemble model of interacting cicadas, finding that a tendency to call more often, driven by light levels, results in all these effects.</p>

<p>5. Results demonstrate how the capacity to self-organise in ecology depends sensitively on environmental conditions. Spatially correlated modulation of cycling rate by an external driver can also promote self-organisation of phase synchrony.</p>",open,,,cc-zero,"<p>Data is presented in csv format, output from MATLAB in Windows 10.</p>

AAV-mediated delivery of a floxed nanobody-TRPV1 into the striatum of adenosine 2a receptor-cre driver mice resulted in motor freezing when placed in an MRI or adjacent to a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device. Functional imaging and fiber photometry both confirmed activation of the target region in response to the magnetic fields.&nbsp; Expression of the same construct in the striatum of wild-type mice along with a second injection of an AAVretro expressing cre into the globus pallidus led to similar circuit specificity and motor responses. Finally, a mutation was generated&nbsp;to gate chloride and inhibit neuronal activity. Expression of this variant in subthalamic nucleus in PitX2-cre parkinsonian mice resulted in reduced local c-fos expression and motor rotational behavior.&nbsp;These data demonstrate that magnetogenetic constructs can bidirectionally regulate activity of specific neuronal circuits non-invasively&nbsp;<em>in-vivo</em>&nbsp;using clinically available devices.</span></p>",open,,,cc-by-4.0,,https://zenodo.org/records/12761093,https://zenodo.org/records/12761092,10.5281/zenodo.12761092,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12761093,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.12761092,,,,,,"https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/record:12761093:Fig.%202B%20RFP%20mouse%202.jpg/full/^10,/0/default.jpg","https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/record:12761093:Fig.%202B%20RFP%20mouse%202.jpg/full/^50,/0/default.jpg","https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/record:12761093:Fig.%202B%20RFP%20mouse%202.jpg/full/^100,/0/default.jpg","https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/record:12761093:Fig.%202B%20RFP%20mouse%202.jpg/full/^250,/0/default.jpg","https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/record:12761093:Fig.%202B%20RFP%20mouse%202.jpg/full/^750,/0/default.jpg","https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/record:12761093:Fig.%202B%20RFP%20mouse%202.jpg/full/^1200,/0/default.jpg",,,,,,,"Unda, Santiago",NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center,0000-0001-7319-6794,"Pomeranz, Lisa",,0000-0002-8117-7355,"Marongiu, Roberta",Weill Cornell Medicine,0000-0002-7609-7000,"Yu, Xiaofei",Fudan University,0000-0002-1712-331X,"Kelly, Leah",,0000-0002-8465-5658,"Hassanzadeh, Gholamreza",,0000-0002-5213-1630,"Molina, Henrik",Mount Sinai Hospital,,"Vaisey, George",Rockefeller University,0000-0002-8359-1314,"Wang, Putianqi",Rockefeller University,,"Dyke, Jonathan",Weill Cornell Medicine,0000-0001-7170-488X,"Fung, Edward",,0000-0002-3390-1548,"Grosenick, Logan",Weill Cornell Medicine,0000-0003-3216-0319,"Zirkel, Rick",,0000-0003-1744-0785,"Antoniazzi, Aldana",Weill Cornell Medicine,0000-0002-0728-3352,"Norman, Sofya",Weill Cornell Medicine,0000-0002-1665-6501,"Liston, Conor",Weill Cornell Medicine,0000-0002-1639-5401,"Schaffer, Chris B.",Cornell University,0000-0002-7800-9596,"Nishimura, Nozomi",Cornell University,0000-0003-4342-9416,"Stanley, Sarah",Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,0000-0002-0253-2663,"Friedman, Jeffrey",Rockefeller University,0000-0002-1738-6873,"Kaplitt, Michael",Weill Cornell Medicine,0000-0002-8979-2459,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1101/2023.07.13.548699,isSupplementedBy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5R01NS097184-05,Remote Electromagnetic Control of Neural Activity for Treatment of Parkinson's Disease,{'name': 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke'},,,,,,

Surprisingly, vocal development in nonhuman primates has been assumed to be largely predetermined and completed within the first postnatal months. Contradicting this assumption, we found a dichotomy between the development of call features and vocal sequences in marmoset monkeys suggestive of a role for experience. While changes in call features were related to physical maturation, sequences of and transitions between calls remained flexible until adulthood. As in humans, marmoset vocal behavior developed in stages correlated with motor and social development stages. These findings are evidence for a prolonged phase of plasticity during marmoset vocal development, a crucial primate evolutionary preadaptation for the emergence of vocal learning and speech.</p>",open,,,cc-zero,<p>Funding provided by: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659<br>Award Number: EXC 307</p><p>Funding provided by: Leon Levy Foundation<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007027<br>Award Number: </p>,https://zenodo.org/records/5160385,https://zenodo.org/records/5160384,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hage, Steffen",University of Tübingen,0000-0002-7018-543X,"Gultekin, Yasemin",German Primate Center,,"Hammerschmidt, Kurt",German Primate Center,,"Hildebrand, David",Rockefeller University,0000-0002-2079-3517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1126/sciadv.abf2938,isCitedBy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that can be used to classify cancers. Recently, a morphology-based classification framework for evaluating NENs from different anatomic sites was proposed by experts, with the requirement of improved molecular data integration. Here, we compiled 378 miRNA expression profiles to examine NEN classification through comprehensive miRNA profiling and data mining. Following data preprocessing, our final study cohort included 221 NEN and 114 non-NEN samples, representing 15 NEN pathological types and five site-matched non-NEN control groups. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of miRNA expression profiles clearly separated NENs from non-NENs. Comparative analyses showed that miR-375 and miR-7 expression is substantially higher in NEN cases than non-NEN controls. Correlation analyses showed that NENs from diverse anatomic sites have convergent miRNA expression programs, likely reflecting morphologic and functional similarities. Using machine learning approaches, we identified 17 miRNAs to discriminate 15 NEN pathological types and subsequently constructed a multi-layer classifier, correctly identifying 217 (98%) of 221 samples and overturning one histologic diagnosis. Through our research, we have identified common and type-specific miRNA tissue markers and constructed an accurate miRNA-based classifier, advancing our understanding of NEN diversity.</p>",open,"['microRNA (miRNA)', 'Small RNAseq', 'neuroendocrine', 'Neoplasms']",,cc-zero,"<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Diagnostic histopathology and small RNA cDNA library preparation information for all samples are presented in <b>Table S1 </b>of the associated manuscript.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

From the top surface of each hair cell protrudes a mechanical antenna, the hair bundle, which the cell uses to detect and amplify auditory stimuli, thus sharpening frequency selectivity and providing a broad dynamic range. Current methods for mechanically stimulating hair bundles are too slow to encompass the frequency range of mammalian hearing and are plagued by inconsistencies. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a method to move individual hair bundles with photonic force. This technique uses an optical fiber whose tip is tapered to a diameter of a few micrometers and endowed with a ball lens to minimize divergence of the light beam. Here we describe the fabrication, characterization, and application of this optical system and demonstrate the rapid application of photonic force to vestibular and cochlear hair cells.</p>",open,,,cc-zero,"<p>Each dataset corresponds to a different figure.

Despite much attention, the question of how this key cognitive trait has evolved remains unanswered. The motor theory for the origin of vocal learning posits that neural centers specialized for vocal learning arose from adjacent areas in the brain devoted to general motor learning. One prediction of this hypothesis is that visual displays that rely on complex motor patterns may also be learned in taxa with vocal learning. While learning of both spoken and gestural languages is well-documented in humans, the occurrence of learned visual displays has rarely been examined in non-human animals. We tested for geographic variation consistent with learning of visual displays in long-billed hermits (Phaethornis longirostris), a lek-mating hummingbird that, like humans, has both learned vocalizations and elaborate visual displays. We found lek-level signatures in both vocal parameters and visual display features, including element proportions, sequence syntax, and fine-scale parameters of elements. This variation was not associated with genetic differentiation between leks. In the absence of genetic differences, geographic variation in vocal signals at small scales is most parsimoniously attributed to learning, suggesting a significant role of social learning in visual display ontogeny. The co-occurrence of learning in vocal and visual displays would be consistent with a parallel evolution of these two signal modalities in this species.",open,"['vocal learning', 'Mirror system hypothesis', 'Leks', 'Visual displays', 'Gestural learning', 'Phaethornis longirostris']",[{'place': 'Costa Rica'}],cc-zero,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Visual display sequences<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Sequences of visual display elements of individual displays by male and lek (first data sheet).

Here, we provide evidence that cumulative cultural evolution has occurred in the learned songs of Savannah sparrows. In a first step, ""click trains"" replaced ""high note clusters"" over a period of three decades. We use mathematical modeling to show that this replacement is consistent with the action of selection, rather than drift or frequency-dependent learning biases. Generations later, young birds elaborated the ""click train"" song form by adding more clicks. We show that the new songs with more clicks elicit stronger behavioural responses from both males and females. Therefore, we suggest that a combination of social learning, innovation, and sexual selection favoring a specific discrete trait was followed by directional sexual selection that resulted in naturally occurring cumulative cultural evolution in the songs of this wild animal population.</p>",open,"['Savannah sparrow', 'song', 'introductory segment', 'feature replacement', 'cumulative cultural evolution', 'frequency-dependent selection', 'drift', 'sexual selection']",,cc-zero,"<p>Williams et al NCOMMS 2022 data.xlsx is a standard excel file.</p>

The extensive growth required to build these ordered substrates is fuelled by cell proliferation, which, naively, should destroy order. Understanding how active morphogenetic mechanisms couple cellular and mechanical processes to generate order — rather than annihilate it — remains an outstanding question in animal development. We show that cell divisions are the primary drivers of tissue flow leading to a fourfold orientationally ordered phase. Waves of anisotropic cell proliferation propagate across the embryo with precise patterning. Defects introduced into the nascent lattice by cell divisions are moved out of the tissue bulk towards the boundary by subsequent divisions. Specific cell proliferation rates and orientations enable cell divisions to organize rather than fluidize the tissue. We observe this using live imaging and tissue cartography to analyse the dynamics of fourfold tissue ordering in the trunk segmental ectoderm of the crustacean <em>Parhyale hawaiensis</em> beginning 72 hours after egg laying. The result is a robust, active mechanism for generating global orientational order in a non-equilibrium system that sets the stage for the subsequent development of shape and form.</p>",open,"['Parhyale hawaiensis', 'Tissue cartography']",,cc-zero,"<p>Code needed to process/view the simulated data can be found at <a href=""https://github.com/DillonCislo/DefectDrivenMorphogenesisPublic.git"">https://github.com/DillonCislo/DefectDrivenMorphogenesisPublic.git</a></p><p>Funding provided by: National Institutes of Health<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002<br>Award Number: 5R35GM138203-02</p><p>Funding provided by: National Science Foundation<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001<br>Award Number: DMR-1720256 (iSuperSeed)</p>",https://zenodo.org/records/7823508,https://zenodo.org/records/7823507,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cislo, Dillon",Rockefeller University,0000-0002-6996-572X,"Yang, Fengshuo",Johns Hopkins University,,"Qin, Haodong","University of California, San Diego",,"Pavlopoulos, Anastasios",Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology,,"Bowick, Mark","University of California, Santa Barbara",,"Streichan, Sebastian","University of California, Santa Barbara",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1101/2021.07.28.453899,isCitedBy,https://github.com/DillonCislo/DefectDrivenMorphogenesisPublic.git,isDerivedFrom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such deviations identified through genome scans have often been attributed to effects of selection instead of randomness. This interpretation assumes that long enough genomic intervals average out randomness in underlying genealogies, which represent local genetic ancestries. However, an alternative explanation to distinct patterns has not been fully addressed: too few genealogies to average out the effect of randomness. Specifically, distinct patterns of genetic variation may be due to reduced local recombination rate, which<br>reduces the number of genealogies in a genomic window. Here, we associate distinct patterns of local genetic variation with reduced recombination rates in a songbird, the Eurasian blackcap (<em>Sylvia atricapilla</em>), using genome sequences and recombination maps. We find that distinct patterns of local genetic variation reflect haplotype structure at low-recombining regions either shared in most populations or found only in a few populations. At the former species-wide low-recombining regions, genetic variation depicts conspicuous haplotypes segregating in multiple populations. At the latter population-specific low-recombining regions, genetic variation represents variance among cryptic haplotypes within the low-recombining populations. With simulations, we confirm that these distinct patterns of haplotype structure evolve due<br>to reduced recombination rate, on which the effects of selection can be overlaid. Our results highlight that distinct patterns of genetic variation can emerge through evolution of reduced local recombination rate. Recombination landscape as an evolvable trait therefore plays an important role determining the heterogeneous distribution of genetic variation along the genome.</p>",open,,,cc-by-4.0,,https://zenodo.org/records/10623362,https://zenodo.org/records/8358873,10.5281/zenodo.8358873,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10623362,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8358873,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jun Ishigohoka,"Max  Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Plön, Germany",,"Bascón-Cardozo, Karen","Max  Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Plön, Germany",,"Bours, Andrea","Max  Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Plön, Germany",,"Fuß, Janina","Institute  of Clinical Molecular Biology (IKMB), Kiel University, Kiel, Germany",,"Rhie, Arang","Genome Informatics Section, Computational and Statistical Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA",,"Mountcastle, Jacquelyn","The Vertebrate Genome Lab, Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA",,"Haase, Bettina","The Vertebrate Genome Lab, Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA",,"Chow, William","Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK",,"Collins, Joanna","Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK",,"Howe, Kerstin","Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK",,"Uliano-Silva, Marcela","Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK",,"Fedrigo, Olivier","The Vertebrate Genome Lab, Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA",,"Jarvis, Erich D.","The Vertebrate Genome Lab, Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA, Laboratory of Neurogenetics of Language, Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA, The Howards Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD, USA",,"Pérez-Tris, Javier","Department of Biodiversity, Ecology and Evolution, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain",,"Illera, Juan Carlos","Biodiversity Research Institute (CSIC-Oviedo University-Principality of Asturias), Oviedo University, Mieres, Spain",,"Liedvogel, Miriam","Max  Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Plön, Germany,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

important clinical implications. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common cause of
nosocomial infections and, critical to its pathogenesis, is its ability to adhere and form
biofilms on surfaces, thereby moderating the effect of the host's immune response and
antibiotics. Commensal S. epidermidis populations are thought to differ from those associated
with disease in factors involved in adhesion and biofilm accumulation. We quantified the
differences in biofilm formation in 98 S. epidermidis isolates from various sources, and
investigated population structure based on ribosomal multilocus typing (rMLST) and the
presence/absence of genes involved in adhesion and biofilm formation. All isolates were able
to adhere and form biofilms in in vitro growth assays and confocal microscopy allowed
classification into 5 biofilm morphotypes based on their thickness, biovolume and roughness.
Phylogenetic reconstruction grouped isolates into three separate clades, with the isolates in
the main disease associated clade displaying diversity in morphotype. Of the biofilm
morphology characteristics, only biofilm thickness had a significant association with clade
distribution. The distribution of some known adhesion-associated genes (aap and sesE)
among isolates showed a significant association with the species clonal frame, with the
exception of. These data challenge the assumption that biofilm-associated genes, such as
those on the ica operon, are genetic markers for less invasive S. epidermidis isolates, and
suggest that phenotypic characteristics, such as adhesion and biofilm formation, are not fixed
by clonal descent but are influenced by the presence of various genes that are mobile among
lineages.",open,"['Hospital-acquired infection', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis', 'Biofilm', 'Skin flora', 'Commensal']",,cc-zero,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Isolate List<div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Dryad data.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Genome assemblies<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Assembled genomes used in this study to identify rMLST, virulence and biofilm-associated gene sequences.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Dryad seq.zip<br></div></div>",https://zenodo.org/records/5013586,https://zenodo.org/records/5013585,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Harris, Llinos",,,"Murray, Susan",Swansea University,,"Pascoe, Ben",Swansea University,,"Bray, James",University of Oxford,,"Meric, Guillaume",Swansea University,,"Magerios, Leonardos",Swansea University,,"Wilkinson, Thomas S.",Swansea University,,"Jeeves, Rose E.",,,"Rohde, Holger",University of Hamburg,,"Schwarz, Stefan",,,"de Lencastre, Herminia",Rockefeller University,,"Miragaia, Maria",,,"Rolo, Joana",,,"Bowden, Rory",Wellcome Trust,,"Jolley, Keith A.",University of Oxford,,"Maiden, Martin C.

The avian pelvis in particular experienced dramatic changes during the transition from early archosaurs to living birds. This stepwise transformation is well documented by an excellent fossil record; however, the ontogenetic alterations that underly it are less well-understood. We used embryological imaging techniques to examine the morphogenesis of avian pelvic tissues in three dimensions, allowing direct comparison with the fossil record. Many ancestral dinosaurian features<span> </span>(e.g., forward-facing pubis, short ilium, pubic 'boot') are transiently present in the early morphogenesis of birds and arrive at their typical 'avian' form after transitioning through a prenatal developmental sequence that mirrors phylogeny. We quantitatively demonstrate that avian pelvic ontogeny closely parallels the dinosaur-to-avian transition and provide evidence for an evolutionary module within the pelvis that is conserved across Archosauria. The presence of ancestral states in avian embryos may stem from this conserved modular relationship. These are further indications that the avian pelvis evolved via terminal addition—a mechanism whereby ancestral states shift to derived states during late development, resulting in retention of ancestral character states. This phenotypic modularity suggests a previously unrecognized mechanism for the promotion of terminal addition, hinting that the retention of ancestral states in development may be common across evolutionary transitions.</p>",open,,,cc-zero,,https://zenodo.org/records/5811094,https://zenodo.org/records/5811093,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Griffin, Christopher",Yale University,0000-0003-3201-1866,"Botelho, João",Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile,,"Hanson, Michael",Yale University,,"Fabbri, Matteo",Yale University,,"Smith-Paredes, Daniel",Yale University,,"Carney, Ryan",University of South Florida,,"Norell, Mark",American Museum of Natural History,,"Egawa, Shiro",RIKEN,,"Gatesy, Stephen",Brown University,,"Rowe, Timothy",The University of Texas at Austin,,"Elsey, Ruth",Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge*,,"Nesbitt, Sterling",Virginia Tech,,"Bhullar, Bhart-Anjan",Yale University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.5281/zenodo.5988758,isDerivedFrom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In closely related species, we might expect the strength of host-associated genomic differentiation (HAD) to be correlated with the degree of phenotypic differentiation in host-adaptive traits. Using microsatellite and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers, and controlling for isolation by distance between populations, we sought HAD in two congeneric species of butterflies with different degrees of host plant specialization. Prior work on Euphydryas editha had shown strong interpopulation differentiation in host-adapted traits, resulting in incipient reproductive isolation among host-associated ecotypes. We show here that Euphydryas aurinia had much weaker host-associated phenotypic differentiation. Contrary to our expectations, we detected HAD in Euphydryas aurinia, but not in E. editha. Even within an E. aurinia population that fed on both hosts, we found weak but significant sympatric HAD that persisted in samples taken 9 years apart. The finding of significantly stronger HAD in the system with less phenotypic differentiation may seem paradoxical. Our findings can be explained by multiple factors, ranging from differences in dispersal or effective population size, to spatial variation in genomic or phenotypic traits and to structure induced by past histories of host-adapted populations. Other infrequently measured factors, such as differences in recombination rates, may also play a role. Our result adds to recent work as a further caution against assumptions of simple relationships between genomic and adaptive phenotypic differentiation.",open,"['Euphydryas editha', 'Euphydryas aurinia', 'Host Parasite Interactions', 'Species Interactions', 'Coevolution']","[{'place': 'North America'}, {'place': 'Spain'}]",cc-zero,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Result from alternative partitioning of data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Raw output R script testing for host associated differentiation, partitioned with either microsatellite data only, or AFLP data only.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">alt analysis.docx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Raw R output<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Raw output from the R script used to run the main analysis.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">R output.docx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Script containing R-based analysis, data matrixes and plotting code<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This archive contains the main analysis and plotting functions, and the data matrixes used in the analysis.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">euphy.zip<br></div></div>",https://zenodo.org/records/4972865,https://zenodo.org/records/4972864,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mikheyev, Alexander S.",Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology,,"McBride, Carolyn S.",Rockefeller University,,"Mueller, Ulrich G.",The University of Texas at Austin,,"Parmesan, Camille",The University of Texas at Austin,,"Smee, Melanie R.",University of York,,"Stefanescu, Constanti",Centre for Research on Ecology and Forestry Applications,,"Wee, Brian",Smithsonian Institution,,"Singer, Michael C.",The University of Texas at Austin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/mec.12423,isCitedBy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we resolve the nearly complete chromosomal genomes of three amphioxus species, one of which best recapitulates the 17 chordate ancestor linkage groups. We reconstruct the fusions, retention, or rearrangements between descendants of whole genome duplications (WGDs), which gave rise to the extant microchromosomes that likely existed in the vertebrate ancestor. Similar to vertebrates, the amphioxus genome gradually establishes its 3D chromatin architecture at the onset of zygotic activation and forms two topologically associated domains at the <em>Hox</em> gene cluster. We find that all three amphioxus species have ZW sex chromosomes with little sequence differentiation, and their putative sex-determining regions are nonhomologous to each other. Our results illuminate the unappreciated interspecific diversity and developmental dynamics of amphioxus genomes and provide high-quality references for understanding the mechanisms of chordate functional genome evolution.</span></p>",open,,,cc-zero,<p>Funding provided by: Fujian Normal University<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010651<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Austrian Science Fund<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428<br>Award Number: J4477-B</p><p>Funding provided by: National Natural Science Foundation of China<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809<br>Award Number: 31722050</p><p>Funding provided by: European Research Council<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781<br>Award Number: 677696</p>,https://zenodo.org/records/7591548,https://zenodo.org/records/7591547,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Huang, Zhen",Fujian Normal University,,"Xu, Luohao",Southwest University,0000-0002-3714-8047,"Cai, Cheng",Zhejiang University,,"Zhou, Yitao",Fujian Normal University,,"Liu, Jing",University of Vienna,,"Zhu, Zexian",Zhejiang University,,"Kang, Wen",Zhejiang University,,"Chen, Duo",Fujian Normal University,,"Pei, Surui",Annoroad Gene Technology (China),,"Xue, Ting",Fujian Normal University,,"Cen, Wan",Fujian Normal University,,"Shi, Chenggang",Xiamen University,,"Wu, Xiaotong",Xiamen University,,"Huang, Yongji",Minjiang University,,"Consortium, Amphioxus genome",Fujian Normal University,,"Jarvis, Erich",Rockefeller University,,"Yu, Jr-Kai",Academia Sinica,,"Li, Guang",Xiamen University,,"Lin, Gang",Fujian Normal University,,"Zhang, Qiujin",Fujian Normal University,,"Zhou, Qi",Zhejiang University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1101/2022.01.04.475009,isCitedBy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During daily mass raids with many thousand workers, army ants hunt live prey, likely exerting strong top-down control on prey species. Many tropical sites exhibit a high army ant species diversity (&gt;20 species), suggesting that sympatric species partition the available prey niches. However, whether and to what extent this is achieved has not been intensively studied yet. We therefore conducted a large-scale diet survey of a community of surface-raiding army ants at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. We systematically collected 3,262 prey items from eleven army ant species (genera Eciton, Nomamyrmex and Neivamyrmex). Prey items were classified as ant prey or non-ant prey. The prey nearly exclusively consisted of other ants (98%), and most booty was ant brood (87%). Using morphological characters and DNA barcoding, we identified a total of 1,105 ant prey specimens to the species level. 129 ant species were detected among the army ant prey, representing about 30% of the known local ant diversity. Using weighted bipartite network analyses, we show that prey specialization in army ants is unexpectedly high, and prey niche overlap very small. Besides food niche differentiation, we uncovered a spatio-temporal niche differentiation in army ant raid activity. We discuss competition-driven multidimensional niche differentiation and predator-prey arms races as possible mechanisms underlying prey specialization in army ants. By combining systematic prey sampling with species-level prey identification and network analyses, our integrative approach can guide future research by portraying how predator-prey interactions in complex communities can be reliably studied, even in cases where morphological prey identification is infeasible.",open,"['competitive release', 'dietary specialization', 'predator-prey network', 'army ant', 'Neivamyrmex', 'Nomamyrmex', 'Eciton', 'prey specialization']","[{'place': 'Neotropics'}, {'place': 'La Selva Biological Station'}, {'place': 'Costa Rica'}]",cc-zero,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Prey overview images<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Overview photos of prey items collected from army ant raids/emigrations/prey caches collected at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.

The mosquito species Aedes aegypti, a major vector of dengue and yellow fever viruses, probably originated as a wild, zoophilic species in sub-Saharan Africa, where some populations still breed in tree holes in forested habitats. Many populations of the species, however, have evolved to thrive in human habitats and to bite humans. This includes some populations within Africa as well as almost all those outside Africa. It is not clear whether all domestic populations are genetically related and represent a single 'domestication' event, or whether association with human habitats has developed multiple times independently within the species. To test the hypotheses above, we screened 24 worldwide population samples of Ae. aegypti at 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci. We identified two distinct genetic clusters: one included all domestic populations outside of Africa and the other included both domestic and forest populations within Africa. This suggests that human association in Africa occurred independently from that in domestic populations across the rest of the world. Additionally, measures of genetic diversity support Ae. aegypti in Africa as the ancestral form of the species. Individuals from domestic populations outside Africa can reliably be assigned back to their population of origin, which will help determine the origins of new introductions of Ae. aegypti.",open,"['mosquito genetics', 'Aedes aegypti', 'human habitats']",,cc-zero,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">MicrosatsforGenepop<div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",https://zenodo.org/records/4938308,https://zenodo.org/records/4938307,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Brown, Julia E.",Yale University,,"McBride, Carolyn S.",Rockefeller University,,"Johnson, Petrina",James Cook University,,"Ritchie, Scott",James Cook University,,"Paupy, Christophe",Institut de Recherche pour le Développement,,"Bossin, Hervé",Institut Louis Malardé,,"Lutomiah, Joel",Kenya Medical Research Institute,,"Fernandez-Salas, Ildefonso",Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León,,"Ponlawat, Alongkot",Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Science,,"Cornel, Anthony J.","University of California, Davis",,"Black, William C.

<p>Sample Processing:</p>

<p>NPCs were immuno-purified from Mlp1 tagged S. cerevisiae strains (Kim et al., 2018). After native elution, 1.0 mM disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was added and the sample was incubated at 25&ordm;C for 40 min with shaking (1,200 rpm). The reaction was quenched by adding a final concentration of 50 mM freshly prepared ammonium bicarbonate and incubating for 20 min with shaking (1,200 rpm) at 25&ordm;C. The sample (50 &micro;g) was then concentrated and denatured at 98&ordm;C for 5 min in a solubilization buffer (10% solution of 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (C12-mim-Cl) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, 100 mM DTT). After denaturation, the sample was centrifuged at 21,130 g for 10 min and the supernatant was transferred to a 100 kDa MWCO ultrafiltration unit (MRCF0R100, Microcon). The sample was quickly spun at 1,000 g for 2 min and washed twice with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. After alkylation (50 mM iodoacetamide), the cross-linked NPC in-filter was digested by trypsin and lysC O/N at 37&ordm;C. After proteolysis, the sample was recovered by centrifugation and peptides were fractionated into 10-12 fractions by using a stage tip self-packed with basic C18 resins (Dr. Masch GmbH). Fractionated samples were pooled prior to LC/MS analysis.</p>

<p>Desalted cross-link peptides were dissolved in the sample loading buffer (5% Methanol, 0.2% FA), separated with an automated nanoLC device (nLC1200, Thermo Fisher), and analyzed by an Orbitrap Q Exactive HFX (Pharma mode) mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) as previously described (Xiang et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2021). Briefly, peptides were loaded onto an analytical column (C18, 1.6 &mu;m particle size, 100 &Aring; pore size, 75 &mu;m &times; 25 cm; IonOpticks) and eluted using a 120-min liquid chromatography gradient. The flow rate was approximately 300 nl/min. The spray voltage was 1.7 kV. The QE HF-X instrument was operated in the data-dependent mode, where the top 10 most abundant ions (mass range 380 &ndash; 2,000, charge state 4 - 8) were fragmented by high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). The target resolution was 120,000 for MS and 15,000 for tandem MS (MS/MS) analyses. The quadrupole isolation window was 1.8 Th; the maximum injection time for MS/MS was set at 200 ms.</p>

<p>Data Processing:</p>

<p>The raw data were searched with pLink2 (Chen et al., 2019b). An initial MS1 search window of 5 Da was allowed to cover all isotopic peaks of the cross-linked peptides. The data were automatically filtered using a mass accuracy of MS1 &le; 10 ppm (parts per million) and MS2 &le; 20 ppm of the theoretical monoisotopic (A0) and other isotopic masses (A+1, A+2, A+3, and A+4) as specified in the software. Other search parameters included cysteine carbamidomethyl as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation as a variable modification. A maximum of two trypsin missed-cleavage sites was allowed. The initial search results were obtained using a default 5% false discovery rate (FDR) expected by the target-decoy search strategy. Spectra were manually verified to improve data quality (Kim et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2014). Cross-linking data were analyzed and plotted with CX-Circos (http://cx-circos.net).</p>",open,"['Nuclear Pore Complex', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Chemical Cross-linking', 'CX-MS', 'Cryo-EM', 'Single Particle Analysis', 'Integrative Modeling']",,cc-by-4.0,,https://zenodo.org/records/5721514,https://zenodo.org/records/5721513,10.5281/zenodo.5721513,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5721514,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5721513,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akey, Christopher W.","Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Boston University School of Medicine, 700 Albany Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA",,"Singh, Digvijay","Section of Molecular Biology, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA",,"Ouch, Christna","Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Boston University School of Medicine, 700 Albany Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 364 Plantation St , Worcester, MA 01605",,"Echeverria, Ignacia","Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA",,"Nudelman, Ilona","Laboratory of Cellular and Structural Biology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, 10065, USA",,"Varberg, Joseph M","Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO, USA",,"Yu, Zulin","Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO, USA",,"Fang, Fei","Department of Cell Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",,"Shi, Yi","Department of Cell Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",,"Wang, Junjie","Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry and Gaseous Ion Chemistry, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA",,"Salzberg, Daniel","Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA",,"Song, Kangkang","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 364 Plantation St , Worcester, MA 01605",,"Xu, Chen","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 364 Plantation St , Worcester, MA 01605",,"Gumbart, James C.","School of Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA",,"Suslov, Sergey","Section of Molecular Biology, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA",,"Unruh, Jay","Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO, USA",,"Jaspersen, Sue L","Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO, USA; Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA",,"Chait, Brian T.","Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry and Gaseous Ion Chemistry, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA",,"Sali, Andrej","Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; Quantitative Biosciences Institute, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA",,"Fernandez-Martinez, Javier","Laboratory of Cellular and Structural Biology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, 10065, USA; Current additional address: Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science, 48013, Bilbao, Spain, and Instituto Biofisika (UPV/EHU, CSIC), University of the Basque Country, 48940, Leioa",,"Ludtke, Steven J.","Verna and Marrs McLean Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas 77030, USA",,"Villa, Elizabeth","Section of Molecular Biology, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA",,"Rout, Michael P.","Laboratory of Cellular and Structural Biology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, 10065, USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we prospectively docked large libraries against unrefined AF2 models of the σ2 and 5-HT2A receptors, testing hundreds of new molecules and comparing results to docking against the experimental structures. Hit rates were high and similar for the experimental and the AF2 structures, as were affinities. The success of docking against the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric residue conformations versus the experimental structures. Determination of the cryoEM structure for one of the more potent 5HT2A ligands from the AF2 docking revealed residue accommodations that resembled the AF2 prediction. AF2 models may sample conformations that differ from experimental structures but remain low energy and relevant for ligand discovery, extending the domain of structure-based ligand discovery.

<p>We describe humans with rare biallelic loss-of-function PTCRA variants impairing pre–a T cell receptor (pre-TCRa) expression. Low circulating naive ab T cell counts at birth persisted over time, with normal memory ab and high gd T cell counts. Their TCRa repertoire was biased, which suggests that noncanonical thymic differentiation pathways can rescue ab T cell development. Only a minority of these individuals were sick, with infection, lymphoproliferation, and/or autoimmunity. We also report that 1 in 4000 individuals from the Middle East and South Asia are homozygous for a common hypomorphic PTCRA variant. They had normal circulating naive ab T cell counts but high gd T cell counts. Although residual pre-TCRa expression drove the differentiation of more ab T cells, autoimmune conditions were more frequent in these patients compared with the general population.</p>

<p>Temporally-regulated alternative splicing choices are vital for proper development yet the wrong splice choice may be detrimental. Here we highlight a novel role for the neurotrophin receptor splice variant TrkB.T1 in neurodevelopment, embryogenesis, transformation, and oncogenesis across multiple tumor types in both humans and mice. TrkB.T1 is the predominant NTRK2 isoform across embryonic organogenesis and forced over-expression of this embryonic pattern causes multiple solid and nonsolid tumors in mice in the context of tumor suppressor loss. TrkB.T1 also emerges the predominant NTRK isoform expressed in a wide range of adult and pediatric tumors, including those harboring TRK fusions. Affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) proteomic analysis reveals TrkB.T1 has distinct interactors with known developmental and oncogenic signaling pathways such as Wnt, TGF-&szlig;, Hedgehog, and Ras. From alterations in splicing factors to changes in gene expression, the discovery of isoform specific oncogenes with embryonic ancestry has the potential to shape the way we think about developmental systems and oncology.</p>",open,,,cc-by-4.0,,https://zenodo.org/records/6629466,https://zenodo.org/records/6629465,10.5281/zenodo.6629465,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6629466,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.6629465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Siobhan S.

Determining the timing and spatial corridors of YFV spread, as well as the geographic hotspots that link the endemic north of the country with epidemic extra-Amazonian regions, are central to predicting and preventing future outbreak and epidemics. Here, we tracked the recent spread of the virus by integrating genome sequences with both epidemiological and vector data. Through a combination of phylogenetic and epidemiological models we reconstructed the recent transmission history of YFV within different epidemic seasons in Brazil. A suitability index based on the highly domesticated <em>Aedes aegypti</em> was able to capture the seasonality of reported human infections. Spatial modelling revealed spatial hotspots with both past reporting and low vaccination coverage, which coincided with many of the largest urban centres in the Southeast. Phylodynamic analysis unravelled the circulation of three distinct YFV lineages, and provided proof of the directionality of a known spatial corridor of viral spread that connects the endemic North with the extra-Amazonian basin. This study illustrates that genomics linked with eco-epidemiology in a One Health framework can provide new insights into the landscape of YFV transmission, augmenting traditional approaches to infectious disease surveillance and control.</p>",open,"['YFV', 'Brazil', 're-emergence', 'suitability', 'genomics', 'corridor of spread']",,cc-by-4.0,,https://zenodo.org/records/8066019,https://zenodo.org/records/8066018,10.5281/zenodo.8066018,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8066019,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8066018,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Marta Giovanetti,"Laboratório de Flavivírus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",,Francesco Pinotti,University of Oxford,,Camila Zanluca,"Laboratório de Virologia Molecular, Instituto Carlos Chagas/Fiocruz-PR, Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil",,Vagner Fonseca,"Organização Pan-Americana da Saúde/Organização Mundial da Saúde, Brasília, Distrito Federal, Brazil",,Taishi Nakase,"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, United Kingdom",,Andrea C.
